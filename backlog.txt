tests are broken on not knowing what Unity.Object.name is


[] render the collection of tiles in Board instead of doing setup in the GameController
[] Board.HexMap(3) should give a hexagonal board with sides of length 3

Can instantiator (or the adaptor interfaces generally) get rid of UnityEngine dependencies?
making larger boards would probably be easier if 0,0 was in the middle of the board
